# jsonstore
This module provides a class that maps keys and values from a JSON file onto its
attributes.

The goal was to provide a convenient way of loading and saving configuration in
a familiar human readable format. This is a bit more flexible than the
[configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html) module which
is included with Python.

This works with Python 2.7+ and Python 3.0+

## Examples

### Basics
```python
# by default JsonStore commits on every change unless in a transaction
store = JsonStore('config.json')
store.a_string = "something"
store.a_list = [1, 2, 3]
store.a_dictionary = {
  'dict-list': [{}],
  'ln(2)': 0.69314718056,
  'for-you': u"💐",
}

# you can use […] to set/get/delete string keys
store['some_key'] = "a value"
# the key is split on '.'s and works on dictionaries
del store['a_dictionary.dict-list']
store['a_dictionary.new_value'] = "old value"

# deep copies are made when assigning values
my_list = ['fun']
store.a_list = my_list
assert store.a_list is not my_list

# deep copies are also returned to avoid unsanitary changes being made
store.a_dictionary['new_value'] = "new value"  # won't update the store!
assert store.a_dictionary['new_value'] == "old value"
assert store.a_dictionary is not store.a_dictionary
```

### Transactions
`JsonStore` objects can be used as [context managers](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/)
to provide transactions which are rolled back in the event of an exception. The
transaction model is primitive; you can only nest transactions.

While a store is put into a transaction, it will not save changes to file until all
of the transactions have been closed.
```python
from jsonstore import JsonStore

# even with auto_commit=True, the file won't be saved until the last contexts has been closed
with JsonStore('config.json', indent=None, auto_commit=False) as store:
  self.value = 1

# the context manager will roll back changes made if an exception is raised
store = JsonStore('config.json', indent=None)
try:
  with store:
    store.value = "new"
    raise Exception
except Exception:
  pass
# here we see the value that was saved previously
assert store.value == 1
```
